\item Architected and developed Appliance Software Upgrade Management \textit{(ASUM)} framework. \textit{ASUM} is deployed in \textit{Veritas Flex Appliance} and \textit{Veritas Iris}. It provides -
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit {zero-downtime rolling upgrade}} functionality for platform and the application upgrade
\item software management capabilities like uploading, deleting and validating packages using RESTful APIs
\end{itemize}
%\textit{ASUM} is deployed in - \textit{Flex Appliance} and \textit{Veritas Iris}.

\item Designed an innovative solution for unit/integration testing of NetBackup containers. It is a framework that provides -
\begin{itemize}
\item ability to spin up multiple NetBackup master and media instances using private IP address
\item easy to add method for \textit{container-based} unit tests including backup-recovery and upgrade
\item ability to deploy a cloud instance locally using \textit{Fake S3} and perform backup-restore testing
\end{itemize}
\item Key contributor in developing a multi-tenancy solution for \textit{Flex Appliance} product. \textit{Flex Appliance} is a highly available and scalable solution that supports multiple instances of NetBackup services and large-scale deployments using \textit{containers} and \textit{Flexible Storage Sharing}. Main contributions include -
\begin{itemize}
\item end to end design and development of storage resize (expand and shrink) feature
\item containerizing NetBackup application
\end{itemize}

\item {\bfseries Clustering and Classification of emails:} Implemented Ridge Regression classifier, kNN classifier, Centroid-based classifier and Spherical k-means for classifying and clustering emails into categories.

\item {\bfseries MapReduce like Compute Framework:} Developed a MapReduce framework for performing computations in distributed fashion; implemented techniques like proactive fault tolerance, fault detection and recovery to guarantee correct results even in the presence of node failures.

\item {\bfseries Distributed File System:} Implemented a Distributed File System in which clients shared files with each other. Multiple clients could read/write files at the same time and the files would be replicated (distributed) across several file servers. Consistency across these files was achieved using Quorum based techniques.

\item {\bfseries Web Scraping \& Data Analysis:} Developed a web scrapper to extract restaurant information. It used a novel technique to locate restaurants using Google Maps \& extract information using Yelp; performed exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis on the user reviews to suggest quality improvements for restaurants.
