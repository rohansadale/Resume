\subsection*{Course Projects}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries A Scalable Movie Recommendation System:} Built a movie recommendation system for suggesting movies to users. The project involved multiple steps such as extracting data from RDBMS, Web Logs and APIs, cleaning data using Hadoop MapReduce jobs, data filtering and transformation using Apache Hive and building scalable item-based recommender using Apache Mahout. (Java, HDFS, Apache Hive, Mahout, R)
\item {\bfseries MapReduce like Compute Framework:} Developed a MapReduce-like compute framework for performing operations in distributed fashion. The framework would receive jobs from a client, split job into multiple tasks, and assign tasks to compute nodes which performed the computations. Proactive fault tolerance, fault detection and recovery were implemented to guarantee correct results even in the presence of node failures. (Java, Apache Thrift)
\item {\bfseries Distributed File System:} Implemented a Distributed File System in which clients shared files with each other. Multiple clients could read/write files at the same time and the files would be replicated (distributed) across several file servers. Achieved consistency across these files using Quorum based techniques. (Java, Apache Thrift)
\item {\bfseries Web Scraping \& Data Analysis:} Developed a web scrapper tool to extract restaurants data across US. The scrapper used a novel technique to locate regions precisely using Google Maps and extracted restaurant info from those regions through Yelp. Later, performed Exploratory data analysis to visualize trends in the data and Sentiment analysis on the user reviews to suggest quality improvements for restaurant owners. (Python, R, MongoDB, XML, JSON)
\item {\bfseries Distributed Hash Table (DHT):} Implemented a File System using DHT based on Chord protocol. The system comprised of three major components - Clients, Nodes and SuperNode. Clients could read or write files to the file system. Nodes formed DHT with help of SuperNode and were used by clients to read and write files. SuperNode maintained Nodes info, helped nodes form DHT \& assisted clients in writing/reading files from appropriate Nodes. (Java, Apache Thrift)

\subsection*{Industry Projects}

\begin{itemize}
 \itemsep0em
 %\begin{itemize}
 \item Designed a framework for \textbf{Logging User Activities} on WillowTV and provided \textbf{APIs for Querying} the Logs. Nginx and uWSGI were used in combination so that system could handle large number of simaltaneous requests. MongoDB's Schema-less approach provided horizontal scalability.   
 
 \item Designed \textbf{Digital Ads Inventory Management System}. System was designed to interpret the playout logs, calculate the total ads of the client played during live/non-live events. It acted as scheduler by providing exact number of ads to be played of specific client on a given day to achieve target committed to client.
 
\item Designed \textbf{Android App} for Willow TV. This apps allows users to watch live cricket,highlights,replays and scorecard. I was responsible for designing the backend API as well as the UI for the app.


\iffalse
\item Integrated \textbf{AuthorizeNet Payment Gateway} on WillowTV. Interaction with AuthorizeNet was done using \textbf{REST APIs} with XML used to post the request to AuthNet APIs. One of the main Challenges was to ensure \textbf{PCI compliance}, which was achieved by storing Credit Card information on payment Gateway servers.

\item Designed \textbf{Flipkart Flyte Mp3 App on Windows 8}. This app allows users to \textbf{search} the catalog, preview a song, \textbf{purchase songs}, and then \textbf{download} any owned content from the flyte cloud. I made the process of downloading songs more robust and improved \textbf{memory usage} by implementing \textbf{UI virtualization}.
