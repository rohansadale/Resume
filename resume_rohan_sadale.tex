\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.4em}%
\item Key contributor in development of \textit{Flex Appliance -} a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution. It is a microservices based, highly available and scalable solution for hosting applications. Major contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and development of storage expand and shrink feature.
\item Containerization of applications and development of RESTful APIs for large scale application deployment across nodes in a cluster.
\item Development of cluster-wide zero-downtime rolling update and rollback functionality for platform and application upgrade.
\end{itemize}

\item Designed an innovative solution for testing containerized applications. The solution provides:
\begin{itemize}
\item ability to spin up multiple application instances in a sandbox environment using private IP addresses.
\item ability to deploy a cloud instance locally using Fake S3.
\item a user-friendly way to simulate platform, add integration tests and generate standardized test reports.
\end{itemize}

\item Developed a streamlined ETL system for generation of financial reports for APAC regulatory bodies.
\item Implemented data models and techniques for extracting data from large scale heterogeneous trading databases; developed data transformation and statistical analysis packages for regulatory purposes.
\item Maintained and enhanced Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) framework; practiced agile methodology for project deliveries.

\item {\bfseries Distributed File System:} Implemented a Distributed File System in which clients shared files with each other. Multiple clients could read/write files at the same time and the files would be replicated (distributed) across several file servers. Consistency across these files was achieved using Quorum based techniques.

\item {\bfseries MapReduce like Compute Framework:} Developed a MapReduce framework for performing computations in distributed fashion; implemented techniques like proactive fault tolerance, fault detection and recovery to guarantee correct results even in the presence of node failures.

\item {\bfseries Clustering and Classification of emails:} Implemented Ridge Regression classifier, kNN classifier, Centroid-based classifier and Spherical k-means for classifying and clustering emails into categories.

\item {\bfseries File system using Chord:} Implemented a file system using Chord \textit{(a protocol for peer to peer distributed hash table).} Clients could read/write files which would be distributed\textit{(stored)} across nodes in the system. The system was highly scalable and provided fast access \textit{(O(logn))} to the files.
