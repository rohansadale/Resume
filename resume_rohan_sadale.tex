\item {\bfseries [Kaggle] Animal Shelter Outcomes:} Built an ensemble model using Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Xgboost to predict the outcome of animals as they leave Animal Center; performed exploratory data analysis to get insights which could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help in finding new home. \textit{(I was ranked in top 8\% (from \~{}1600 participants).}

\item {\bfseries Clustering and Classification of emails:} Implemented  \textit{(from scratch) highly efficient} Ridge Regression classifier, kNN classifier, Centroid-based classifier and Spherical k-means for classifying and clustering emails into categories.

\item {\bfseries Web Scraping \& Data Analysis:} Developed a scrapper to extract restaurant information from Yelp. It used a novel technique to locate regions precisely using Google Maps API and extracted information from those regions through Yelp. Later, performed Exploratory data analysis to get insights and Sentiment analysis on the user reviews to suggest quality improvements for restaurant owners.

\item {\bfseries A Scalable Movie Recommendation System:} Built a movie recommendation system using Big Data Tools. The project involved multiple steps such as extracting data from MySQL and Twitter (scraping), data cleansing using Apache Hive and building a scalable item-based recommender using Apache Mahout.

\item {\bfseries MapReduce like Compute Framework:} Developed a MapReduce framework for performing computations in distributed fashion; implemented techniques like proactive fault tolerance, fault detection and recovery to guarantee correct results even in the presence of node failures.

\item {\bfseries Distributed File System:} Implemented a Distributed File System in which clients shared files with each other. Multiple clients could read/write files at the same time and the files would be replicated (distributed) across several file servers. Consistency across these files was achieved using Quorum based techniques.
